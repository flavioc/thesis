This chapter provides an overview of the proof theoretic basis behind LM and the
dynamic semantics of the language. First, we will present the subset of linear
logic on which LM is built. Second, we present the high level dynamic semantics,
i.e., how rules are evaluated and how node communication is done, followed by
the low level dynamics, a close representation of how the virtual machine runs
and we prove that the low level dynamic semantics are sound in relation to the
high level dynamic semantics. The presence of rule priorities, comprehensions
and aggregates makes the low level dynamic semantics not complete, since these
are features are not represented directly by the underlying linear logic system.
This is the same approach used in Prolog, which includes useful features such as
the \emph{cut operator} and a depth-first search strategy that make the language
sound but not complete. Note that the semantics presented in this chapter do not
take into account coordination or thread-based facts. This chapter may be
skipped without loss of understanding of the main thesis of the dissertation.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter we presented the proof theoretic foundations of LM.  First, we
introduced the sequent calculus of the linear logic fragment that supports LM. We then
presented HLD, the high level dynamic semantics that was created by interpreting
the linear logic fragment using focusing and chaining. Next, we designed LLD,
an abstract machine for the operational semantics that mimics the execution of
rules in our virtual machine minus small details.  Finally, we proved that LLD is sound
in relation to HLD, thus showing a connection from LLD to the linear logic
fragment.
