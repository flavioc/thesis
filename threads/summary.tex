In this chapter, we have extended the LM language with a declarative mechanism
for reasoning about the underlying parallel architecture. LM programs can be
first written in a data-driven fashion and then optimized by reasoning about the
state of threads, enabling the move from implicit parallelism to explicit
parallelism. We have presented four programs that showcase the potential of the
new mechanism and several experimental results that validate our approach.
