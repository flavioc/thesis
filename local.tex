This chapter describes the sequential components of the LM's implementation,
including the database data structures, rule scheduling and compilation
algorithms. First, we give a brief overview of the LM's implementation,
including its compiler and virtual machine. Next, we present the node data
structure, including a detailed description of the data structures used to
efficiently manipulate logical facts. We also describe how rules are scheduled
locally from newly derived facts stored in the database.  Finally, we give a
description of the compilation algorithm that turns logical rules into efficient
compiled code.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter, we gave an overview of LM's implementation, including the
compiler and the virtual machine. We focused on the sequential aspects of the
implementation, namely, the data structures used for manipulating facts and how
the compiler turns logical rules into efficient code. In the next chapter, we
focus on the parallel aspects of the virtual machine.
