Linear Meld (LM) is a forward chaining logic programming language where a
program is defined by a \emph{database of facts} and by a set of
\emph{derivation rules}. LM supports structured manipulation of mutable state
through the use of linear logic~\cite{girard-87} by supporting two types of
logical facts, namely, \emph{persistent facts} (which cannot be retracted) and
\emph{linear facts} (which can be retracted).

LM programs are evaluated as follows. Initially, we populate the database with
the program's initial facts and then determine which derivation rules can be
applied by using the facts from the database. Once a rule is applied, we derive
new facts, which are then added to the database. If a rule uses linear facts,
they are consumed and thus deleted from the database. The program stops when we
reach \emph{quiescence}, that is, when we can no longer obtain new facts through
rule derivation.

LM sees the database of facts as a graph data structure where each node contains
facts belonging to that node. The database of facts can also be seen as a
collection of node objects and each node contains several attributes represented
as facts that describe the node. Derivation rules are restricted so that they
are only allowed to manipulate facts belonging to the same node. This
restriction allows nodes of the graph to compute independently of other nodes
since they can only perform computation with their current attributes.
Communication between nodes arises when a rule derives a fact that belongs to
another node. These design decisions allow LM to be concurrent but also make LM
easier to implement.

\section{A Taste Of LM}

In order to understand how LM programs are written, we now present and discuss
three elementary LM programs.

\section{Types and Locality}

Each fact is an association between a \emph{predicate} and a tuple of values. A
predicate is a pair with a name and a tuple of types (the argument types). LM
rules are type-checked using the predicate declarations in the header of the
program. LM has a simple type system that includes the following basic types:
\emph{node}, \emph{int}, \emph{float}, \emph{string}, \emph{bool}. The following
structured types are also supported: \emph{list} $X$, for lists of type $X$;
\emph{struct} $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, for composite values made of $n$ elements; and
\emph{array} $X$, for arrays of type $X$.

LM allows the definition of new type names from simpler types using the declaration
\code{type simple-type new-type} in the header of the program. The type
\code{new-type} can then be used as any other type. Note that LM uses
\emph{structural equivalence} to check if two types are the same, therefore
\code{simple-type} and \code{new-type} are type equivalent.

Type checking LM programs is straightforward due to its simple type system and
mandatory predicate declarations. For each rule, the variables found in the LHS
are mapped to types based on their use on atomic proposition arguments. Some
constraints of the form \code{X = expression} that force an equality between
\code{X} and \code{expression} may actually represent an \emph{assignment} if
\code{X} is not defined by any LHS atomic proposition. In this case, all the
variables in \code{expression} must be typed and \code{X} is assigned the value
of \code{expression} during run time.  Any variable used in the RHS of the rule
must be defined in the LHS, because otherwise derived facts would not be
\emph{grounded}, that is, some arguments would be undefined or uncomputable.
For comprehensions and aggregates, type checking is identical, however, the LHS
of each construct must declare explicitly the variables in scope.

Another important component of type checking is \emph{locality checking}. The
first argument of each atomic proposition in the LHS must use the same variable
in order to enforce locality and allow concurrency. This \emph{home variable} is
always typed as a \emph{node} and represents a node in the program's graph. In
the rule's RHS, other home variables are allowed, as long as they have been
defined in the LHS. For comprehensions and aggregates, the LHS must use the
same home argument as the rule's LHS.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter, we gave an overview of the LM language, including its syntax
and operational semantics. We also explained how to write programs using all the
facilities provided by LM, including linear facts, comprehensions, and
aggregates. We also explained how to informally prove the correctness of several
LM programs.
