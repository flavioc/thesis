Linear Meld (LM) is a \emph{forward chaining} logic programming language in the
style of Datalog~\cite{Ullman:1990:PDK:533142}. The program is defined as a
\emph{database of facts} and a set of \emph{derivation rules}.  Initially, we
populate the database with the program's initial facts and then determine which
derivation rules can be applied by using the current database. Once a rule is
applied, we derive new facts, which are then added to the database.  If a rule
uses linear facts, they are consumed and thus deleted from the database.  The
program stops when we reach \emph{quiescence}, that is, when we can no longer
able to obtain new facts through rule derivation.

LM departs from Datalog by making the database of facts a graph data structure
where each node contains a fraction of the database. Derivation rules are then
restricted so that they are only allowed to manipulate facts belonging to the
same node. This restriction allows multiple nodes of the graph to perform
independent rule derivations at the node level, thus introducing concurrency in
the program. Communication between nodes arises when a derivation rule derives a
fact that is in another node.

\section{A Taste Of LM}

In order to understand how LM programs are written, we now present and discuss
three basic LM programs.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter we gave an overview of the LM language, including its syntax and
operational semantics.  We also explained how to write programs using all the
facilities provided by LM, including linear facts and comprehensions. We also
explained how to informally prove the correctness of several LM programs.  The implicit
parallelism of LM arising from database partitioning and rule restriction allows
programs to be run in a concurrent fashion.
