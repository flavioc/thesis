In this chapter, we introduce background concepts related to parallel
programming, declarative programming with a focus on logic programming,
coordination and provability of parallel programs. Some sections of this chapter
may be skipped if the reader is already familiar with the topics at hand.

In this chapter, we presented the background concepts of this thesis, including
parallel programming, declarative programming, coordination, and provability. In
the next chapters, we delve more deeply on some of these concepts by including a
separate section about recent work that is related to the material covered by
each chapter.
