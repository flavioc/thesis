	Abstract = {Recent research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express a distributed system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language or its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time.

In this paper we present Dedalus, a foundation language for programming and reasoning about distributed systems. Dedalus reduces to a subset of Datalog with negation, aggregate functions, successor and choice, and admits an explicit representation of time into the logic language. We show that Dedalus provides a declarative foundation for the two signature features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous processing and communication. Given these two features, we address three important properties of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of safety appropriate to non-terminating computations, stratified monotonic reasoning with negation over time, and efficient evaluation over time via a simple execution strategy. We also provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal notions of safety and stratification. Our experience implementing full-featured systems in variants of Datalog suggests that Dedalus is well-suited to the specification of rich distributed services and protocols, and provides both cleaner semantics and richer tests of correctness.},

	Abstract = { Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a rule- and logic-based formalism and has established itself as an active research topic. In contrast to other rule-based approaches, CHR is both, a theoretical formalism related to first-order and linear-logic, and a practical rule-based programming language. Other rule- and logic-based approaches have been successfully embedded in CHR. For this reason, it is considered a candidate for a lingua-franca of such approaches. We investigate CHR{\^A}Â´s suitability for this purpose exemplarily, by considering an embedding of graph transformation systems (GTSs) in CHR, which helps us in identifying points of improvements for strengthening the lingua-franca argument further. In particular, we present a novel formulation of the operational semantics of CHR, which is founded on an equivalence relation over CHR states. It justifies the perspective on CHR as a rule-based rewriting system of equivalence classes, which abstracts over infinitely many possible syntactic variations of a CHR state. Overall, this equivalence-based operational semantics provides a powerful formal analysis tool for CHR, which can significantly reduce proof complexity. The lingua-franca argument implies a potential for cross-fertilization of research. Hence, we revisit program analysis methods available in the CHR literature. Our extended methods apply an invariant to make implicit assumptions explicitly available during analysis, hence, effectively eliminating irrelevant states. The resulting methods are applicable to strictly larger classes of CHR programs and provide more promising approaches towards analyzing more complex programs. Finally, we compare program analysis methods in GTSs and CHR. We find that the adapted CHR confluence test, when applied to a GTS embedded in CHR, corresponds to a sufficient criterion for confluence of the GTS. Similarly, we introduce program equivalence for GTSs with a sufficient criterion based on the CHR program equivalence test. },

	Abstract = {The Threaded Abstract Machine (TAM) refines dataflow
     execution models to address the critical constraints that modern
     parallel architectures place on the compilation of
     general-purpose parallel programming languages. TAM defines a
     self-scheduled machine language of parallel threads, which
     provides a path from dataflow-graph program representations to
     conventional control flow. The most important feature of TAM is
     the way it exposes the interaction between the handling of
     asynchronous message events, the scheduling of computation, and
     the utilization of the storage hierarchy. This paper provides a
     complete description of TAM and codifies the model in terms of a
     pseudo machine language TL0. Issues in compilation from a high
     level parallel language to TL0 are discussed in general and
     specifically in regard to the Id90 language. The implementation
     of TL0 on the CM-5 multiprocessor is explained in detail. Using
     this implementation, a cost model is developed for the various
     TAM primitives. The TAM approach is evaluated on sizable Id90
     programs on a 64 processor system. The scheduling hierarchy of
     quanta and threads is shown to provide substantial locality while
     tolerating long latencies. This allows the average thread
     scheduling cost to be extremely low.},

@techreport{AICPub641:1983,
	Abstract = {This report describes an abstract Prolog instruction set suitable for
     software, firmware, or hardware implementation. The instruction set is abstract
     in that certain details of its encoding and implementation are left open, so
     that it may be realized in a number of different forms. The forms that are
     contemplated are: 

 em Translation into a compact bytecode, with emulators
     written in C (for maximum portability), Progol (a macrolanguage generating
     machine code, for efficient software implementations as an alternative to direct
     compilation on machines such as the VAX), and VAX-730 microcode. em Compilation
     into the standard instructions of machines such as the VAX or DECsystem-10/20.
     em Hardware (or firmware) emulation of the instruction set on a specially designed
     Prolog processor. 
 The abstract machine described herein (``new Prolog
     Engine'') is a major revision of the ``old Prolog Engine''
     described in a previous document. The new model overcomes certain difficulties
     in the old model, which are discussed in a later section. The new model can
     be considered to be a modification of the old model, where the stack contains
     compiler-defined goals called environments instead of user-defined goals. The
     environments correspond to some number of goals forming the tail of a clause.
     The old model was developed having primarily in mind a VAX-730 microcode implementation.
     The new model has, in addition, been influenced by hardware implementation
     considerations, but should remain equally amenable to software or firmware
     implementation on machines such as the VAX.},
