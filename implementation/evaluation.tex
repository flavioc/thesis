In this section, we evaluate the performance and scalability of the VM. The main
goals of this evaluation are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Compare the performance of LM programs against hand-written
      imperative C++ programs;
   \item Evaluate the scalability of said LM programs when using up to 20 cores
      concurrently;
   \item Understand the impact and effectiveness of our dynamic indexing
      algorithm and its indexing data structures used for logical facts (namely,
      hash tables);
   \item Understand the impact of the thread allocator and fact allocator on scalability and
      multicore performance;
\end{itemize}

For our experimental setup, we used a computer with a 24 (4x6) Core AMD
Opteron(tm) Processor 8425 HE $@$ 800 MHz with 64 GBytes of RAM memory running
the Linux Kernel 3.15.10-201.fc20.x86\_64. The C++ compiler used is the GCC
4.8.3 (g++) with the following \code{CXXFLAGS} flags: \code{-O3 -std=c++11
-march=x86-64}.  All experiments were executed 3 times and the running times
were averaged.

\subsection{Performance}

To understand the absolute performance of LM programs, we measured their
``sequential'' performance using a single thread of execution against
hand-written sequential C++ programs. Arguably, compiled C/C++ programs are a
good standard for understanding the baseline performance of new language
runtimes, since compiled C/C++ programs tend to come up on top on several
popular programming language benchmarksi~\cite{language_benchmarks}.
Furthermore, the performance of sequential C++ programs is a better baseline for
measuring the scalability of LM since these programs are sequential and thus
provide a better baseline than the ``sequential'' run time of LM programs,
which includes extra code for managing synchronization between multiple
(inexistent) threads.

In order to make our comparison more interesting, we also provide comparisons to
the Python language and other relevant systems. Python is a \emph{scripting}
programming language that is much slower than compiled C/C++ programs and thus
is a good upper-bound in terms of performance.

The goal of the evaluation is to understand the effectiveness of our compilation
strategy and the effectiveness of our dynamic indexing algorithms, including the
data structures (hash tables) which are used to store index logical facts. The
LM programs used in the experiments are the following:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Multiple Single Shortest Distance (MSSD): a program that computes the
      shortest distance from a subset of nodes of the graph to the all the nodes
      in the graph. A modified version is presented in
      Section~\ref{section:coord:rationale}.

   \item N-Queens: the classic puzzle for placing queens on a chess board so
      that no two queens threaten each other. Program is explained in
      Section~\ref{section:coord:nqueens}.

   \item Belief Propagation: a machine learning to denoise images. Program is
      explained in Section~\ref{sec:coordination:bp}.

    \item Heat Transfer: an asynchronous program that performs transfer of heat
       between nodes. Program is explained in Section~\ref{section:coord:ht}.

    \item MiniMax: the AI algorithm for selecting the best player move in a
       Tic-Tac-Toe game. The initial board was augmented in order to provide a
       longer running benchmark. Program is presented in
       Section~\ref{section:coord:minimax}.
