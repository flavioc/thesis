In this section, we evaluate the performance and scalability of the VM. The main
goals of our evaluation are:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Compare the performance of LM programs against hand-written
      imperative C++ programs;
   \item Evaluate the scalability of LM programs when using up to 32 cores
      in parallel;
   \item Understand the impact and effectiveness of our dynamic indexing
      algorithm and its indexing data structures used for logical facts (namely,
      hash tables);
   \item Understand the impact of the memory allocator on scalability and
      multicore performance and compare it against alternative designs;
\end{itemize}

For our experimental setup, we used a computer with a 24 (4x6) Core AMD
Opteron(tm) Processor 8425 HE $@$ 800 MHz with 64 GBytes of RAM memory running
the Linux Kernel 3.15.10-201.fc20.x86\_64. The C++ compiler used is the GCC
4.8.3 (g++) with the following \code{CXXFLAGS} flags: \code{-O3 -std=c++11
-march=x86-64}.  All experiments were executed 3 times and the running times
were averaged.
