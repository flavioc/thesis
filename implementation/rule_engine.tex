The rule engine decides which rules may need to be executed while taking into
account rule priorities. The rule engine is composed of 3 data structures, which
we describe as follows:

\begin{itemize}

   \item \texttt{Rule Queue} is the bitmap representing the rules scheduled to
      run. The bit $i-1$ is set if the rule number $i$ is scheduled to run,
      which depends on fact availability (do we have all the facts required to
      run the rule?). Rules are executed by fetching the least significant bit
      of the bitmap, unsetting that bit and then executing the corresponding
      rule. This is an operation that is accomplished using the \emph{Bit Scan
      Forward (bsf)} assembly instruction available on x86/x86-64 machines;

   \item \texttt{Rule Counter}, which keeps a count of the number of predicates
      needed by the rule that exist in the database. For the rule \texttt{a,
      e(1) -o b} then the rule needs predicates \texttt{a} and \texttt{e} and
      the rule counter is at the most 2 (where the rule can be executed). The
      \texttt{Rule Queue} bitmap is updated when the rule counter is increments
      or decrements to the maximum possible value;

   \item \texttt{Predicate Bitmap} is a bitmap representing the existence of a
      given predicate in the database. When a predicate becomes available then
      the \texttt{Rule Counter} is updated to take into account the existence of
      new facts.

\end{itemize}

To understand how our engine works, consider the following set of facts and
rules:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left,fontsize=\codesize]
a, e(1) -o b.  // rule 1
a -o c.        // rule 2
b -o d.        // rule 3
e(0) -o f.     // rule 4
c -o e(1).     // rule 5

a.
e(0).
\end{Verbatim}

   \caption{Rule engine data structures for a program with five rules. The
      initial state is represented in (a), where the rules scheduled to run are
      1, 2 and 4. After attempting rule 1, bit 0 is unset from the \emph{Rule
      Queue}, resulting in (b). Figure (c) is the result of deriving rule 2,
      \code{a -o c}, which marks rule 5 in the \emph{Rule Queue} since the rule
      is now marked as ``available`` in the \emph{Rule Counter}.}

Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:rule_engine} shows the rule engine data
structures for this example. Since we have facts for predicates \texttt{a} and
\texttt{e}, the \texttt{Rules Counter} starts with rules 1, 2 and 4 with 2, 1, 1
predicate counts. Since these rules have the required counter to be applied, the
\texttt{Rule Queue} bitmap starts with the same three rules
(Fig.~\ref{fig:implementation:rule_engine}(a)). In order to pick rules for
execution, we take the rule corresponding to the least significant bit from the
\texttt{Rule Queue} bitmap, initially the first rule \texttt{a, e(1) -o b}.
However, since we don't have fact \texttt{e(1)}, this rule fails and its bit in
\texttt{Rule Queue} must be set to 0.
Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:rule_engine}(b) shows the rule engine data
structures at that point.

The next rule in \texttt{Rule Queue} is the second rule \texttt{a -o c}.
Because the this rule succeeds, fact \texttt{a} is consumed and fact \texttt{c}
is derived. We thus update \texttt{Predicates Bitmap} accordingly, decreasing
the counters for the first and second rules in \texttt{Rule Counter} since such
rules are no longer applicable (\texttt{a} was consumed), and increase the
counter for the fifth rule since \texttt{c} was derived. Finally, to update the
\texttt{Rule Queue}, we must schedule the fifth rule since its counter has been
increased to the required number (we have all predicates).  In the continuation,
the rule engine will schedule the fourth and fifth rules to run.
Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:rule_engine}(b) shows the rule engine data
structures at that point.

Note that every node in the program has the same set of data structures
presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:implementation:rule_engine}. We use 64 bit integers
to implement the 2 bitmaps and an array of 16 bits integers for \texttt{Rule
Counter}.

We do a small optimization to reduce the number of derivations of persistent
facts and, for that, we divide the program rules into two sets: \emph{persistent
rules} and \emph{non persistent rules}. Persistent rules are rules where only
persistent facts are involved. We compile such rules incrementally, i.e., we
attempt to fire all rules where a persistent fact is used. This is called the
\emph{pipelined semi-naive} evaluation and it originated in the P2
system~\cite{Loo-condie-garofalakis-p2}. This evaluation method avoids excessive
re-derivations of the same fact. The order of derivation does not matter for
those rules, since only persistent facts are used.
