In this section, we list all the extra-logical directives available in LM
programs.

The following directives are related to coordination:

\input{coordination/global}

For predicate indexing, we have the following directive:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \code{index pred/arg}: Informs the compiler that predicate \code{pred}
      should be indexed by the argument \code{arg} (number). The runtime system
      will use hash tree data structures for facts of this predicate indexed by
      the requested argument.
\end{itemize}
