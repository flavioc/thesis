This chapter describes the multicore aspects of the LM's virtual machine and
provides a detailed experimental evaluation. First, we give an overview of how
local node computation and parallelism are integrated to provide a scalable
implementation, with a focus on locking and memory allocation. We conclude the
chapter with an evaluation section that evaluates the performance, memory usage
and scalability of our implementation.

\section{Chapter Summary}

This chapter provided a full description of the implementation of LM, including
its compiler and virtual machine. We explained how the virtual machine is
organized to provide scalable multi threaded execution and fast fact assertion
and retraction using efficient data structures. We also gave a detailed
description of the compilation algorithm used to transform LM rules into
efficient C++ code.
