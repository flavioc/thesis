This chapter describes the multicore aspects of the LM's virtual machine and
provides a detailed experimental evaluation. First, we give an overview of how
local node computation and parallelism are integrated to provide a scalable
implementation, with a focus on locking and memory allocation. We conclude the
chapter with an evaluation section that evaluates the performance, memory usage
and scalability of our implementation.

\section{Chapter Summary}

This chapter provided a full description of the multicore implementation of LM,
with a focus on thread management, work stealing and memory allocation.  We
explained how the virtual machine is organized to provide scalable multi
threaded execution and provided experiments on a wide range of problems to
demonstrate its applicability and scalability. We also studied the importance of
good memory allocators for improved scalability and execution.
