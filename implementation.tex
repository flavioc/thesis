This chapter describes the multicore implementation of the LM language,
including its compiler, supporting runtime and parallelism. We first start with
an overview of the implementation in order to understand how all pieces of the
implementation fit together. Secondly, we describe how parallelism is achieved,
including its data structures and thread scheduling. Thirdly, we present the
implementation details of coordination and how it relates with parallelism.  We
then describe the runtime and data structure used to implement nodes and the
database of facts, followed by the compilation algorithm used by our compiler to
turn logical rules into efficient C++ code.

\section{Summary}

This section provided a full description of the implementation of LM. Although the parallel and load balancing facilities of the
runtime system are mostly completed, there is still some implementation work to be done, specially at the coordination level.
We also explained how \lang can be implemented in different distributed systems.
