\begin{itemize}

   \item \texttt{priority @order ORDER} (\texttt{ORDER} can be either \code{asc}
      or \code{desc}): Defines if priorities are to be selected by the smallest
      or the greatest value, respectively.

   \item \texttt{priority @default P}: Informs the runtime system that all nodes
      must start with default priority \code{P}. Alternatively, the programmer can define a
      \texttt{set-default-priority(A, P)} fact.

   \item \texttt{priority @base P}: Informs the runtime system that the
      \emph{base priority} should be \code{P}. The base priority is, by default,
      0 when the priority ordering is \code{desc} and $+\infty$ when the ordering
      is \code{asc} and represents the smallest priority value possible.

   \item \texttt{priority @initial P}: Informs the runtime system that all nodes
   must start with temporary priority \code{P}. Alternatively, the programmer can define an
      \texttt{set-priority(A, P)} fact. The default is value is the one defined
      as the \emph{base priority}.
