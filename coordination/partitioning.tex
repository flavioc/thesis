We provide several coordination facts for dealing with node partitioning among
the running threads. Since each node is placed in some thread, the partitioning
facts revolve around thread placement.

In terms of action facts, we have the
following:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \code{set-cpu(node A, thread T)}: Moves node \texttt{A} to thread
   \texttt{T}.

   \item \code{set-affinity(node A, node B)}: Places node \texttt{B} in
   the thread of node \texttt{A}.

   \item \code{set-moving(node A)}: Allows node \texttt{A} to move freely
   between threads.

   \item \code{set-static(node A)}: Forces node \texttt{A} to stay in the
   same thread indefinitely.

\end{itemize}

As an example of \texttt{set-cpu}, consider the graph in
Fig.~\ref{fig:coordination:priorities}. If a coordination fact
\texttt{set-cpu(@2, T1)} is derived, then node \texttt{@2} will become part of
the sub-graph of thread \texttt{T1}. The result is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:coordination:partitioning}.

   \texttt{set-cpu(@2, T1)}.}

\end{figure}


Sensing facts retrieve information about node placement and are specified as
follows:

\begin{itemize}

   \item \code{cpu-id(node A, node B, thread T)}: Store at node \texttt{A} which
      thread \texttt{T}, \texttt{B} is actually running on.

   \item \code{is-moving(node A, node B)}: Fact available at node \texttt{A} if
      \texttt{B} is allowed to move between threads.

   \item \code{is-static(node A, node B)}: Fact available at node \texttt{A} if
      \texttt{B} is not allowed to move between threads.

   \item \code{just-moved(node A)}: Linear fact derived after the \code{set-cpu}
      action is performed and the node is running on the target thread.

\end{itemize}
