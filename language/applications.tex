In this section, we present solutions to well-known problems. We start with
straightforward graph-based problems such as bipartitness checking and two
versions of the PageRank program. Next, we present an LM version of the
Quick-Sort algorithm which, from a first impression, was not expected to fit
well under the programming paradigm offered by LM. Informal correctness and
termination proofs are also included to further show that such important
properties are relatively easy to prove for programs written in LM.
