In this section, we present more LM solutions to well-known problems. We start
with straightforward graph-based problems such as bipartitness checking and the
PageRank program. Next, we present a version of the Quick-Sort algorithm which,
from a first impression, was not expected to fit well under the programming
paradigm offered by LM. Informal correctness and termination proofs are also
included to further show that it is easy to reason about LM programs.
