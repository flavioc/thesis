In this section, we present solutions to well-known problems. We start with
straightforward graph-based problems such as bipartitness checking and two
versions of the PageRank program. Next, we present the LM version of the
Quick-Sort algorithm, which from a first impression may not fit well under the
programming paradigm offered by LM. Informal correctness and termination proofs
are also included to further show that such important properties are relatively
easy to prove for programs written in LM.
