The problem of checking if a graph is bipartite can be seen as a 2-color graph
coloring problem.  The code for this algorithm is shown in
Fig.~\ref{language:code:bichecking}. All nodes in the graph start as
\code{uncolored}, because they do not have a color yet. The axiom
\code{visit(@1, 1)} is instantiated at node \code{@1}
(line~\ref{line:language:bc_axiom}) in order to color it with color 1.

If a node is \code{uncolored} and needs to be marked with a color \code{P}
then the rule in
lines~\ref{line:language:bc_first1}-\ref{line:language:bc_first2} is applied. We
consume the \code{uncolored} fact and derive a \code{colored(A, P)} to
effectively color the node with \code{P}. We also derive \code{visit(B,
next(P))} in neighbor nodes to color them with the other color. 

The coloring can fail if a node is already colored with a color \code{P} and
needs to be colored with a different color (line~\ref{line:language:bc_third})
or if it has already failed (line~\ref{line:language:bc_fourth}).

\subsubsection{Proof of correctness}

In order to show that the code in Fig.~\ref{language:code:bichecking} works as
intended, we first setup some invariants that hold throughout the execution of
the program. Assume that the set of nodes in the graph is represented as $N$.

\begin{invariant}[Node state]
Set of nodes $N$ is partitioned into 4 different states that represent the 4
possible states that a node can be in, namely:

\begin{itemize}
   \item $U$ (\code{uncolored} nodes)
   \item $F$ (\code{fail} nodes)
   \item $C_{true}$ (\code{colored(A, 1)} nodes)
   \item $C_{false}$ (\code{colored(A, 2)} nodes)
\end{itemize}
\end{invariant}
\begin{proof}
Initially, all nodes start in set $U$. All the 4 rules of the programs either
keep the node in the same set or exchange the node with another set.
\end{proof}

A bipartite graph is one where in every edge $a \leftrightarrow b$, there is a
valid assignment that makes $a$ member of set $C_{true}$ or $C_{false}$ and node
$b$ member of either $C_{false}$ or $C_{true}$ respectively.

\begin{variant}[Bipartiteness
   Convergence]\label{language:lemma:bipartite_convergence}
   We now reason from the application of the program rules. After each
   application of an inference rule, one of the following will happen:

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Set $U$ will decrease and set $C_{true}$ or $C_{false}$ will
         increase, with a potential increase in the number of \code{visit}
         facts.
      \item Set $C_{true}$ or $C_{false}$ will stay the same, while the number
         of \code{visit} facts will be reduced.

      \item Set $C_{true}$ or $C_{false}$ will decrease and set $F$ will
         increase, while the number of \code{visit} facts will be reduced.

      \item Set $F$ will stay the same, while the number of \code{visit} facts
         decreases.
   \end{enumerate}

\end{variant}
\begin{proof}
Directly from the rules.
\end{proof}

From this variant, it can be inferred that set $U$ never increases in size
and in a node transition from \code{uncolored} to \code{colored}, the
database may increase in size. For every other rule application, the database of
facts always decreases. This also means that the program will eventually
terminate, since it is limited by the number of \code{visit} facts that can be
generated.

\begin{theorem}[Bipartiteness Correctness]
If the graph is connected and bipartite then the nodes will be partitioned into sets
$C_{true}$ and $C_{false}$, while sets $F$ and $U$ are empty.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
   By induction, we prove that uncolored nodes become part of either $C_{true}$
   and $C_{false}$ and, if there is an edge between nodes in the two sets then
   they have different colors.

   In the base case, we start with empty sets but node \code{@1} is made
   member of $C_{true}$. Rule 1 sends \code{visit} facts to the neighbors of
   \code{@1}, forcing them to be members of $C_{false}$.

   In the inductive case, we have sets $C'_{true}$ and $C'_{false}$ with some
   nodes already colored. From Lemma~\ref{language:lemma:bipartite_convergence},
   we know that $U$ always decreases. Since the graph is bipartite, events 3 and
   4 never happen since there is a possible partitioning of nodes. With event 1,
   we have set $C_{true} = C'_{true}, n$, (or $C_{false}$) where $n$ is the
   node and with event 2, the sets remain the same. Since the graph is
   connected, every node will be colored, therefore event 1 will happen for
   every node of the graph.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Bipartite Failure]

If the graph is connected but not bipartite then some nodes will be partitioned
into sets $C_{true}$, $C_{false}$, $F$, and possibly $U$.

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

Assume that the algorithm completely partitions the nodes into sets $C_{true}$
and $C_{false}$. Since the graph is connected, we know that the algorithm tries
to build a valid partitioning represented by $C_{true}$ and $C_{false}$. This is
a contradiction because the graph is not bipartite.

\end{proof}
