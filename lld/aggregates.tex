Aggregates can be seen as a more general case of comprehensions. The major
differences are: (1) aggregates accumulate a list of values for each combination
and (2) aggregates have a second head to be derived before deriving the
remaining head terms.

The match judgment $\ma{AG} \Gamma; \Delta; \Xi_N; \Gamma_{N1};
\Delta_{N1}; \Xi; \Omega; \lstack{C}; \lstack{P}; \Omega_N; \Delta_N; \Sigma \rightarrow
\outsem$ is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

   \item[$\Delta$] multi-set of linear facts remaining up to this point in the
   matching process;

   \item[$\Xi_N$] multi-set of linear facts used during the matching process of
   the body of the rule and all the previous aggregates;

   \item[$\Gamma_{N1}$] set of persistent facts derived up to this point in the
   head of the rule;

   \item[$\Delta_{N1}$] multi-set of linear facts derived up to this point in
   the head of the rule;

   \item[$\Xi$] multi-set of linear facts consumed up to this point;

   \item[$\Omega$] ordered list of terms that need to be matched for the
   comprehension to be applied;

   \item[$\lstack{C}$] continuation stack that contains both linear and persistent
   frames. The first frame must be linear;

   \item[$\lstack{P}$] initial part of the continuation stack with only persistent
   frames;

   \item[$AG$] aggregate $\aggsz{A}{B}{C}$ that is being matched;

   \item[$\Omega_N$] ordered list of remaining terms of the head of the rule to
   be derived;

   \item[$\Delta_N$] multi-set of linear facts that were still available after
   matching the body of the rule and all the previous aggregates. Note that
   $\Delta, \Xi = \Delta_N$;

   \item[$\Sigma$] the list of aggregated values.

\end{enumerate}

The judgment $\ma{AG}$is similar to $\mc{AB}$but it has the extra $\Sigma$ argument that
represents the list of aggregated values. We extend the $\Psi$ context to
include triplets $x : M : \tau$ (variable, term and type) instead of pairs $M :
\tau$ in order to be able to retrieve bound variables for all $\ma{AG}$judgments.
Remember that $\Psi$ is used for the quantification connectives in \fragment.

\subsubsection{Successful match}

When the aggregate body finally matches, we retrieve the term for variable $x$
(the aggregate variable) and add it to the list $\Sigma$.

\subsubsection{Continuation stack update}

After matching a single aggregate, the stack is updated as if it was a
comprehension: we drop all but the first linear continuation frame and then fix
the contexts of the remaining stack.  The judgment that updates the stack has
the form $\fixa{AG} \Gamma; \Delta; \Xi_N; \Gamma_{N1}; \Delta_{N1}; \Xi; \lstack{C};
\lstack{P}; \Omega_N; \Delta_N; \Sigma \rightarrow \outsem$ and every argument
has the usual meaning.

\subsubsection{Aggregate continuation}

If the aggregate match fails, we need to backtrack. The judgment for
backtracking has the form $\conta{AG} \Gamma; \Delta_N; \Xi_N; \Delta_{N1};
\lstack{C}; \lstack{P}; \Omega_N; \Sigma \rightarrow \outsem$.
